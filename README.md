# Stock and Revenue Dashboard Analysis for Tesla and GameStop

This project extracts stock data and revenue data for **Tesla** and **GameStop**. The goal is to create a dashboard comparing the price of the stock with the revenue for each company using **yfinance** and **web scraping**.

## Project Overview

As a data scientist working for an investment firm, I was tasked with analyzing the financial performance of Tesla and GameStop by comparing their stock prices with their revenue over time. The data was fetched using the `yfinance` library for stock prices and web scraping techniques for revenue data. The results were displayed on dashboards using **matplotlib**.

  - `yfinance`
  - `pandas`
  - `requests`
